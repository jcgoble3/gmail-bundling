                When enabled, clicking the Archive button inside an email,
                while working in a bundle (or a search query),
                will automatically return to the bundled email list or search results.
                Then, if there are no emails remaining in the bundle or search query,
                you will be automatically returned to the main Inbox screen
                after a brief delay (typically less than a second).
                Additionally, upon clicking the Delete button from inside an email,
                you will likewise be returned to the Inbox if none remain.

            <p><strong>WARNING: This is an experimental feature; use at your own risk!</strong> Currently known issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In some cases, the automatic clicking can cause the popup message with the Undo link to be killed.</li>
                <li>Automatic navigation does not work when deleting or archiving from the email list using hover actions or checkboxes; it only works from the toolbar buttons when viewing the contents of an email.</li>
